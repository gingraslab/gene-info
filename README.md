# Gene Info Chrome extension

This browser extension allows you to retrieve information about a gene directly from a webpage simply by clicking on its name, gene ID or accession (Ensembl gene, Ensembl protein, RefSeq or UniProt). The extension will work on any true webpage but not applications that are embedded in the browser, such as Google Docs or PDF viewers.

This extension is developed by the laboratory of Dr. Anne-Claude Gingras at the Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute in Toronto, Canada.

## Adding resources

If you would like see a resource added to the extension please submit an [issue](https://github.com/knightjdr/gene-info/issues) using the "Add my resource" template and provide the requested information. Resources must be:
* Not for profit
* Open to the public without login
* We must be able to download the resource in its entirety as we merge all incorporated databases together to make request processing faster
