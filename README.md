# Gene Info Chrome extension

## Adding resources

If you would like see a resource added to the extension please submit an [issue](https://github.com/knightjdr/gene-info/issues) using the "Add my resource" template and provide the requested information. Resources must be:
* Not for profit
* Open to the public without login
* We must be able to download the resource in its entirety as we merge all incorporated databases into one to make request processing faster
