Double click on a gene name to retrieve information about it and links to related resources.

Information can be displayed as a detailed report or as a minimal tooltip with links to outside resources.

The information displayed can be customized via the extensions popup menu (more options will be added in the future).

Information is from UniProt and BioGRID. Currently, only human searches are supported but other species will be added in the future.

On first installation, the double-click feature must be enabled via the extension's popup menu. Activation of this event is given to the user to prevent the extension from conflicting with others that work in a similar way (such as the Google dictionary extension).
